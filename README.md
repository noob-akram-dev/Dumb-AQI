# Dumb AQI

Dumb AQI is a Next.js application that provides Air Quality Index (AQI) information for locations across India. It makes the data easy to understand by providing relatable examples generated by AI.

This project was bootstrapped in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## How to Edit

This application is designed to be edited conversationally within Firebase Studio. You can request changes to the code, and the AI assistant will modify the files for you.

However, if you are editing the files directly, here is a guide to the project structure:

### Key Files and Folders

-   `src/app/page.tsx`: This is the main entry point for the application's UI. It renders the `AqiDashboard` component.

-   `src/components/aqi-dashboard.tsx`: This is the primary interactive component. It contains the logic for selecting a location (either through geolocation or dropdowns) and fetching the AQI data.

-   `src/components/aqi-result-card.tsx`: This component displays the final AQI score and the AI-generated examples.

-   `src/app/actions.ts`: This file contains the server-side logic (Next.js Server Actions) for fetching data from the CPCB API, parsing it, and interacting with the Genkit AI flow.

-   `src/ai/flows/generate-aqi-impact-examples.ts`: This is the Genkit flow. It defines the AI prompt and the logic for generating the relatable AQI examples. If you want to change how the examples are generated, this is the file to edit.

-   `src/app/globals.css`: This file contains the global styles for the application, including the Tailwind CSS configuration and the color theme (using CSS variables).

-   `public/icon.svg`: This is the favicon for the application. You can replace this file to change the icon.
